## About

I build **practical, data-driven products** with a strong focus on clarity, metrics, and reproducibility.

My work usually follows a simple but rigorous path:

**Python / SQL → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation → clean exports & documentation**

I care as much about *what a model does* as about **how it is built, explained, and maintained**.  
All my code and technical documentation are published openly on GitHub.
