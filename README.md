## About

I build **practical, data-driven products** with a strong focus on clarity, metrics, and reproducibility.

My work usually follows a simple but rigorous path:

**Python / SQL → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation → clean exports & documentation**

I care as much about *what a model does* as about **how it is built, explained, and maintained**.  
All my code and technical documentation are published openly on GitHub.

## Core skills

### Programming & Data
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, LightGBM)
- SQL (DuckDB, analytical queries)
- Parquet / analytical datasets

### Data products & delivery
- Streamlit dashboards
- Clear notebooks (EDA → modeling → interpretation)
- Power BI (business-facing analysis)

### Engineering foundations
- Git & GitHub (clean history, reproducible repos)
- GitHub Actions (basic CI)
- Docker & GCP (foundations)
